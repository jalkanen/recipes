Yaki Meshi - fried noodles
=================

1 onion
1 carrot
4 eggs
50g smoked ribs
100g peeled shrimp
boiled rice
salt and pepper

Cut onion into small pieces, cut carrot and ribs to small cubes.

Heat up oil in a wok or a frying pan. Break egg in pan, scramble it. Add rice and other ingredients and fry until done. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Make only one portion at a time; the egg binds the oil and prevents food from sticking to the pan during frying.
