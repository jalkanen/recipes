Ramen
-----

Ingredients for the broth (1.4 liters):

* 600g pork bones
* 60g chicken bones
* 2.5l water
* green part of leek

* 4 eggs (hard-boiled, halved)
* smoked ribs
* bean sprouts
* leek
* noodles

* 4 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp sake
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1 tsp salt

Make broth by braising bones and leek for 1-2 hrs. Sieve through cloth.

Boil noodles according to instructions. Bring bean sprouts to boil and wash them with cold water.

Slice the leek diagonally (looks better that way, IMHO.)

Put spices in a bowl, pour broth over it.  Put noodles, egg halves, smoked ribs, bean sprouts and sliced leek on top of everything. Serve.
