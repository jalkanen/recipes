My recipe collection in a geek-friendly way. These are from various sources.

Pull requests welcome. A few notes though:

* Verbatim copies from cook books are copyrighted. While recipes themselves aren't copyrightable, 
  you can't just cut-n-paste stuff. At least make it sound original.
* Please use commonly known measurements - I really hate to guess which "cup" you mean: US,
  Australian, British.
* Use metric figures please - or mark very carefully if you're using Fahrenheits or gallons or millifurlongs. Pull requests to normalize these to metric welcome.
