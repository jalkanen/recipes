ANZAC biscuits
==============

* 125g (4oz) flour
* 150g (6oz) sugar
* 1 cup desicated coconut
* 1 cup rolled oats
* 100g (3.5oz) butter
* 1 tbsp golden syrup
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 2 tbsp boiling water

Mix flour, sugar, coconut, and rolled oats.  Melt butter and golden
syrup.  Dissolve baking soda in boiling water and add to butter and
golden syrup.

Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, then stir in liquid.
Place spoonfuls of mixture on greased tray.  I've found that round
cookie cutters work perhaps the best.  Make sure you don't pack the
mixture too tight.

Bake 15-20 mins at 180C (350F).
